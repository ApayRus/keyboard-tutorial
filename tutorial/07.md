Interactivity is when a user interacts with an app, and see results (almost immediately).

Our app should handle user generated events: mouse clicks, phone screen taps, keyboard key presses.

## Reactive state, @click event, method call (refactor `LangSwitcher`)

When we change a component variable value (state), and it causes change in a visible app (view), it is called **reactive state**. Reactivity means connection between component variables and a view.

- In `vue` such **reactive variables** should be placed in the method `data()`.
- The most common approach to change them — by **methods**.
- Methods are called from **event listeners**, described in `methods`, and placed in a template (e.g. `@click="keyClick(keyContent)"`).

Let’s add to `LangSwitcher`:

- a method `data()` with a returned property (state) `currentLang: 'en'` (‘en’ as default)
- a property `methods` with a new method `switchLang(lang)`
- in the template
  - a new event handler @click to element `<div class="lang">`
  - a new `div` to display reactive variable `currentLang`. It is temporary, after testing we’ll delete it.

The idea is to move the red circle to the lang code that we clicked. Also, we need to store selected lang in some variable.

LangSwitcher.js

```jsx
const LangSwitcher = {
	template: `
	<div class="langSwitcher">
		<div 
			v-for="lang in langs" 
			class="lang"
			@click="switchLang(lang)"
		>
			{{lang}}
		</div>
    </div>
	<div style="text-align: center;">
		{{currentLang}}
	</div>`,
	props: {
		langs: Array
	},
	/* add: */
	data() {
		return {
			currentLang: 'en'
		}
	},
	/* add: */
	methods: {
		switchLang(lang) {
			this.currentLang = lang
		}
	}
}

export default LangSwitcher
```

In the template `@click="switchLang(lang)"` -- by clicking on the element where it placed (`<div class=”lang”>`) the method `switchLang` will be called with a parameter `lang` wich is particular to each `<div>` and can be ‘en’, ‘ru’, ‘ar’.

That’s how **a user input (click) on dynamic generated elements changes a reactive state**.

Result:

You see that after a click on a lang code, component state `currentLang` is changed in the `div` below.

## Conditional styling

Instead of the `currentLang` text, we need a red round background under the active lang.

Conditional styling is when we apply some styling to an element, only if a condition is true.

`:class='["lang", {active: currentLang === lang}]'` this string in a template will do all work for us.

LangSwitcher.js template

```html
<div
	v-for="lang in langs"
	:class='["lang", {active: currentLang === lang}]'
	@click="switchLang(lang)"
>
	{{lang}}
</div>
```

1-st element in the array is a string (because of quotes), that means that the class `lang` will be attached to `<div>` in any case (without condition).

2-nd element is an object like `{styleName: booleanCondition}`. Class `active` will be attached to `<div class="lang">` only if the prop `lang` of the element is equal to the state `currentLang`.

In `styles.css` we defined before:

```css
.lang {
	width: 2rem;
	height: 2rem;
	border-radius: 1rem;
	...;
}

.langSwitcher .active {
	background-color: red;
	color: white;
}
```

That’s why the red round follows our clicks on lang codes — because of attaching and detaching the class `active`.

## Change parent state from a child

Changing parent state from a child is kinda opposite to passing props from parent to child (what we made a lot before). It is another important approach to share data between components

- In a parent we create a reactive state and a method to change it
- we pass this method to child as a prop
- we call it (with params) from the child

When you call a method received from a prop, notice that actually it happens where it was defined, not where it was called from.

If the parent state was passed as a prop to multiple components, if we change this state (from any child, by method received as a prop) — then all components with this state (as prop) will be updated. That is how a little child component from hierarchy bottom can globally affect on the whole app — by calling a method, that changes parent state.

In small apps like our, it is common to have reactive state and main logic in the top level component as `<App>` and pass the state and methods to children (`<Keyboard>`, `<LangSwitcher>`) as props.

For now `currentLang` is placed in `<LangSwitcher>`. But we need this value also in `<Keyboard>` and `<Key>`.

`<LangSwitcher>` and `<Keyboard>` are siblings, they haven’t parent-child relations, but have common parent. So, to share the state `currentLang` between siblings, we should lift it up to the common ancestor `<App>`.

(image from chapter 4)

Let’s move state `currentLang` and method `switchLang` from `<LangSwitcher>` to `<App>` and then pass them as props to `<LangSwitcher>` and use them there.

Open `LangSwitcher.js` and remove `data()` and `methods`. Add to props: `currentLang`, `switchLang`.

LangSwitcher.js

```javascript
const LangSwitcher = {
	template: `
	<div class="langSwitcher">
		<div 
			v-for="lang in langs" 
			:class='["lang", {active: currentLang === lang}]'
			@click="switchLang(lang)"
		>
			{{lang}}
		</div>
	</div>`,
	props: {
		langs: Array,
		/* add: */
		currentLang: String,
		switchLang: Function
	}
	/* delete: 
	data() {
		return {
			currentLang: 'en'
		}
	},
	methods: {
		switchLang(lang) {
			this.currentLang = lang
		}
	} 
	*/
}

export default LangSwitcher
```

Open `App.js`. Add to `data()` a new state `currentLang: 'en'`. Paste whole `methods` from old `LangSwitcher.js`.

In the `template`

- pass to `<vue-lang-switcher>` 2 new props: `switchLang` and `currentLang`
- add `{{currentLang}}` to test our changes.

App.js

```javascript
import Keyboard from './components/Keyboard.js'
import LangSwitcher from './components/LangSwitcher.js'

const App = {
	template: `App-{{currentLang}}
	<vue-lang-switcher 
		:langs="langs" 
		:switchLang="switchLang" 
		:currentLang="currentLang" 
	/>
	<vue-keyboard />
	`,
	components: {
		'vue-lang-switcher': LangSwitcher,
		'vue-keyboard': Keyboard
	},
	mounted() {
		import(`./keyboardData/en.js`).then(result => {
			const { default: keyboardData } = result
			this.keyboardData = keyboardData
		})
	},
	data() {
		return {
			langs: ['en', 'ru', 'ar'],
			/* add: */
			currentLang: 'en'
		}
	},
	/* add: */
	methods: {
		switchLang(lang) {
			this.currentLang = lang
		}
	}
}

export default App
```

Result:

Notice, when we do something in `LangSwitcher` it changes `App` state. We change the parent state from the child with the method that we passed from the parent to the child as a prop. Before these changes `currentLang` was available only in `<LangSwitcher>`, and `<App>` hasn't access to it. Now `<App>` and `<LangSwitcher>` have access to `currentLang`. And we can pass it also to `<Keyboard>` and `<Key>`.

## Switching keyboards (languages)

### Another languages data

Open a folder `keyboardData`. Copy and paste there a file `en.js` twice. Rename clones to `ru.js` and `ar.js`. Change a content (copy from here or type).

ru.js

```javascript
const keyboard = [
	[
		{ code: 'Escape', label: 'Esc' },
		{ code: 'F1' },
		{ code: 'F2' },
		{ code: 'F3' },
		{ code: 'F4' },
		{ code: 'F5' },
		{ code: 'F6' }
	],
	[
		{
			code: 'Backquote',
			main: 'ё',
			shifted: 'Ё'
		},
		{
			code: 'Digit1',
			main: '1',
			shifted: '!'
		},
		{
			code: 'Digit2',
			main: '2',
			shifted: '"'
		},
		{
			code: 'Digit3',
			main: '3',
			shifted: '№'
		},
		{
			code: 'Digit4',
			main: '4',
			shifted: ';'
		},
		{
			code: 'Digit5',
			main: '5',
			shifted: '%'
		}
	],
	[
		{ code: 'Tab' },
		{
			code: 'KeyQ',
			main: 'й',
			shifted: 'Й'
		},
		{
			code: 'KeyW',
			main: 'ц',
			shifted: 'Ц'
		},
		{
			code: 'KeyE',
			main: 'у',
			shifted: 'У'
		},
		{
			code: 'KeyR',
			main: 'к',
			shifted: 'К'
		}
	]
]

export default keyboard
```

ar.js

```javascript
const keyboard = [
	[
		{ code: 'Escape', label: 'Esc' },
		{ code: 'F1' },
		{ code: 'F2' },
		{ code: 'F3' },
		{ code: 'F4' },
		{ code: 'F5' },
		{ code: 'F6' }
	],
	[
		{
			code: 'Backquote',
			main: '٫',
			shifted: '٬'
		},
		{
			code: 'Digit1',
			main: '١',
			shifted: '!'
		},
		{
			code: 'Digit2',
			main: '٢',
			shifted: '@'
		},
		{
			code: 'Digit3',
			main: '٣',
			shifted: '#'
		},
		{
			code: 'Digit4',
			main: '٤',
			shifted: '$'
		},
		{
			code: 'Digit5',
			main: '٥',
			shifted: '٪'
		}
	],
	[
		{ code: 'Tab' },
		{
			code: 'KeyQ',
			main: 'ض',
			shifted: 'َ'
		},
		{
			code: 'KeyW',
			main: 'ص',
			shifted: 'ً'
		},
		{
			code: 'KeyE',
			main: 'ث',
			shifted: 'ُ'
		},
		{
			code: 'KeyR',
			main: 'ق',
			shifted: 'ٌ'
		}
	]
]

export default keyboard
```

Arabic diacritic symbols aren't looking good in the code. But don't worry about it. It will work well for our purposes.

### Dynamic import for `keyboardData`

In App.js pass `currentLang` to `Keyboard`.

App.js template

```html
<vue-keyboard :currentLang="currentLang" />
```

In `Keyboard.js`:

- receive the new prop
- watch its changes
- add a new method `getKeyboardData`
- call `getKeyboardData` on `mounted()` and on change prop `currentLang`

Keyboard.js

```js
import Key from './Key.js'

const Keyboard = {
	template: `
	<div class="keyboard">
		<div
			v-for="(row, index) in keyboardData"
			:class="['row', 'row-'+(index+1)]"
		>
			<vue-key
				v-for="keyContent in row"
				:keyContent="keyContent"
			/>
		</div>
	</div>
`,
	components: {
		'vue-key': Key
	},
	data() {
		return { keyboardData: [] }
	},
	/* receive a new prop  */
	props: {
		currentLang: String
	},
	watch: {
		/* add function, that will be called when prop changes */
		currentLang: function (currentLang) {
			this.getKeyboardData(currentLang)
		}
	},
	/* happens when app opened for the first time */
	mounted() {
		this.getKeyboardData(this.currentLang)
	},
	methods: {
		async getKeyboardData(lang) {
			const { default: keyboardData } = await import(
				`../keyboardData/${lang}.js`
			)
			this.keyboardData = keyboardData
		}
	}
}

export default Keyboard
```

If you noticed `async/await` in the method `getKeyboardData` -- that is an alternative syntax for promises. This code is asynchronous, because reading a file takes time, and we should wait for result to move further through our scenario.

We shared `currentLang` state between siblings `LangSwitcher` and `Keyboard` through their common ancestor `App`.

With a few lines of code we achieved a big improvement of functionality. That is because we organized code well: in a modular way, with intuitive props, methods, and structure.
