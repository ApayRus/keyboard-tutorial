Modularity is when we use one piece of code (module) for all similar parts of our app.

What we have written until now are markup with repeating parts, and styles. E.g. there is a lot of similar blocks for each key (hundreds of them, and can be thousands):

```html
<div class="key">
	<div class="main">2</div>
	<div class="shifted">@</div>
</div>
```

Now, if we decide to change something in such elements, we should change them all manually.

If we had only 1 template for each key, changing code in one place will automatically change every key in the app.

## JavaScript

I am sorry to say, but: HTML and CSS aren't programming languages.

Modularity can be achieved only by programming.

Browser apps are coded in JavaScript (JS).

JS was made in 1995 and DOM (document object model in the browser) — in 1998. Writing code in plain (vanilla) JS and direct manipulations with DOM is kinda hard (and old-fashioned).

But there is no alternative to JS.

## Framework

So programmers invented modern frameworks, that make coding web apps easier, clearer and faster. We will use the simplest of them: Vue. Frameworks also allow us to write JS in a component way. Component is a module with a template and all its logic.

### Setup

In index.html comment all code inside tag `<body>`. We need later, but not now.

index.html

```html
<body>
	<!--
    ...
    -->
</body>
```

Copy code example from: https://vuejs.org/guide/quick-start.html#without-build-tools (or from here):

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/vue@3"></script>

<div id="app">{{ message }}</div>

<script>
	const { createApp } = Vue

	createApp({
		data() {
			return {
				message: 'Hello Vue!'
			}
		}
	}).mount('#app')
</script>
```

and paste it to index.html after `<body>` tag. Save file and look at the app in the browser. If “Hello Vue!” appeared on top of the page it means that setup works.

Even though it works, we need to organize code better.

### Entry point — `index.js`

Put first `<script>` tag into the `<head>` tag.

index.html

```html
<head>
	...
	<script src="https://unpkg.com/vue@3"></script>
</head>
```

Cut second `<script>` tag content (`ctrl+x`) and remove remained wrapper. Create in the project root directory a file `index.js` and paste there what you've copied before.

index.js

```js
const { createApp } = Vue

createApp({
	data() {
		return {
			message: 'Hello Vue!'
		}
	}
}).mount('#app')
```

In index.html, add string just before closing `</body>` tag:

index.html

```html
    ...
    <script src="./index.js" type="module"></script>
</body>
```

Attribute `type="module"` allows us to use ES6 feature `import/export`. We need it on the next step.

index.html (result)

```html
<head>
	...
	<script src="https://unpkg.com/vue@3"></script>
</head>
<body>
	<div id="app">{{ message }}</div>
	<!-- ... -->
	<script src="./index.js" type="module"></script>
</body>
```

If you did everything right, you should see "Hello Vue!" at the top of the page as before.

index.js is called the `entry point`. It mounts all our app code into `index.html` document.

We put `<script src="https://unpkg.com/vue@3">` on the top of the document because we need to load framework code as soon as possible.

And we put the `<script src="./index.js" type="module">` on the bottom, because written by us code needs everything above loaded before it can work.

### Root component — App.js

Open index.js. The code inside `createApp(...)` is a vue component called the root component — cut it (`ctrl+x` or copy and delete). We will move it to separate file. Create in the project root directory a file `App.js`. Paste there a code you copied before (`ctrl+v`) to `const App`. Then export it.

App.js

```js
const App = {
	data() {
		return {
			message: 'Hello Vue!!'
		}
	}
}

export default App
```

Then import it in `index.js` and put into `createApp(...)`

index.js

```javascript
import App from './App.js'

const { createApp } = Vue

createApp(App).mount('#app')
```

If you did everything right, you should see "Hello Vue!" in the browser as before.

## Components hierarchy

First we create all components as colored rectangles to test how works our framework, and to build component hierarchy:

```html
<App>
	<LangSwitcher />
	<Keyboard>
		<Key />
	</Keyboard>
</App>
```

`<App>` is parent for `<LangSwitcher>` and `<Keyboard>`.

`<Keyboard>` is parent for `<Key>`.

`<App>` is grandpa for `<Key>`.

We can also say, that `<Key>` is a child of `<Keyboard>` etc.

### App

We already have `App` component. Just add to

styles.css

```CSS
...
#app {
	background-color: red;
	padding: 10px;
}
```

All styles in this section are temporary, we need them to see component nesting. Then we'll delete them.

Now App is a red rectangle.

### LangSwitcher

Create a directory `components` in the project root directory, and create there a file `LangSwitcher.js`

```js
const LangSwitcher = {
	template: `<div class="langSwitcher">LangSwitcher</div>`
}

export default LangSwitcher
```

Vue component is a JS object with predefined properties. One of them is `template`. We assigned to property `template` a string value with a plain html.

Write styles for it.

styles.css

```CSS
.langSwitcher {
	background-color: green;
	padding: 10px;
}
```

Add a newly created component to the root component

App.js

```js
import LangSwitcher from './components/LangSwitcher.js'

const App = {
	template: `App <vue-lang-switcher />`,
	components: {
		'vue-lang-switcher': LangSwitcher
	}
}

export default App
```

If we use one component inside another, we should fill `components` property with an object. A property `'vue-lang-switcher'` is a valid custom html tag name. Its value is imported `LangSwitcher` module. After that we can use imported (child) component inside `template`.

Result:

We see here that `App` contains `LangSwitcher` which is correct.

### Keyboard

Create a file `Keyboard.js` in the `components` folder

Keyboard.js

```js
const Keyboard = {
	template: `<div class="keyboard">Keyboard</div>`
}

export default Keyboard
```

Add to

styles.css

```css
.keyboard {
	background-color: blue;
	padding: 10px;
	display: flex; /* to display keys in a row, on the next step */
}
```

Add a new component Keyboard to

App.js

```js
import LangSwitcher from './components/LangSwitcher.js'
import Keyboard from './components/Keyboard.js'

const App = {
	template: `App 
	<vue-lang-switcher />
	<vue-keyboard />
	`,
	components: {
		'vue-lang-switcher': LangSwitcher,
		'vue-keyboard': Keyboard
	}
}

export default App
```

Now the app looks like:

### Key

Create file `Key.js` in `components` directory

Key.js

```javascript
const Key = {
	template: `<div class="key">Key</div>`
}

export default Key
```

Add to

styles.css

```css
.key {
	background-color: yellow;
	padding: 10px;
	color: black;
}
```

As you remember `Key` is the child of `Keyboard`, so it should be imported in `Keyboard`, not in `App.js`.

Keyboard.js

```js
import Key from './Key.js'

const Keyboard = {
	template: `<div class="keyboard">
                    Keyboard
                    <vue-key />
                    <vue-key />
                    <vue-key />
                </div>`,
	components: {
		'vue-key': Key
	}
}

export default Keyboard
```

Save all files.

Result

Our component hierarchy works well. All components have correct nesting. How we said it the beginning of the chapter:

> `<App>` is parent for `<LangSwitcher>` and `<Keyboard>`.
> `<Keyboard>` is parent for `<Key>`.
